                    Exceptionally good comfort food cinema.


                    An exciting music score and high-quality fight scenes go a long way toward keeping interest up during its two-hour-45-minute running time.


                    Certainly one of the better Salman Khan movies in the recent times - watch Tiger Zinda Hai for its action sequences, excellent background score and performances by the ensemble cast.


                    Watch this if you are in the mood to see a stoic, stone-faced swashbuckling superhero, aka Salman Khan, and some supremely well-executed action sequences. Don't go looking for soul, though.


                    A lot of sequences defy logic, but at the same time, there are many moments that will leave Salman Khan and action film fans impressed.


                    The explosive Khan-Kaif combination turns out to be a damp squib, undone by staggering ambition and matching incompetence.


                    If there is ever a third film in the works in this action franchise, then the filmmakers would do well to put Kaif in the spotlight and give Tiger some down time.


                    The heady mixture of an international looking action film and the regular tropes of Hindi cinema make it a pleasing watch.


                    There's still some time to catch up with Hollywood, but Tiger Zinda Hai is probably the best a filmmaker could do with a superstar.
